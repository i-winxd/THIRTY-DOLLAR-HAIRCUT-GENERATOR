DO NOT RENAME THIS FILE
THE LINE OF THIS FILE REPRESENTS THE MIDI NOTE NUMBER
WHERE 60 <-> C5.
On the left side, state a
thirty dollar haircut
instrument. The lines
of this file represent
the midi note number, so
it would be really helpful
to edit this text file in
an IDE rather than notepad.
At least one that can visualize
numbers.
A reminder that if there's a MIDI
note that doesn't map to a
30 dollar haircut sound
effect here, then
the midi note will be
dropped entirely - treated
as if it never existed in the
first place.
Double slashes represent comments.
Any text to the right of double slashes will be ignored.
Leading or trailing whitespaces do not matter. Start here.
Text after // will be treated as a comment. REMEMBER: THE LINE NUMBER OF THE TEXT HERE MATTERS!!!
What really matters is whether there's a '|' in a line and whether there's an instrument after it.
