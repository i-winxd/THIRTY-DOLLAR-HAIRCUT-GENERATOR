# DON'T YOU LECTURE ME WITH YOUR THIRTY DOLLAR WEBSITE MIDI GENERATOR
Tired of clicking every panel on that site? This program's your solution.

## Setting up your midi
I'm assuming you know a bit about midis. Each midi file
has different midi channels. The best way to figure them out
is to drag the file into fl studio, and look at the FL studio midi prompt.



## How do I open this?
You can either use the .py files or the exe. The py files are harder to set up
but if you feel the exe is too sus, you can always use the py files.

### If you are using the exe file
Click it to run it. That's it.

### If you are using the .py files
Okay. Here's how you do it:

1. Install python. If you're running windows 10, type ``python``
into your command prompt to get windows 10 to shove the windows 10
store in your face to get you to install **the latest version of python
(version 3.10). Don't use version 3.9 (actually, don't, because type annotation
stuff)
2. Install easygui VIA pip. Basically type ``pip install easygui`` in your
command prompt.
3. Run the .py file using python 3.10 (using open with).
